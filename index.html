            <ol id="box2">
            <li> Java 
                
                This is the first programming language I learned and the one I feel most comfortable with.
                I've programmed in this language for multiple assignments, and group projects. 
            </li>
            <li> Python 
                
                This is a language that I've used for classes such as Computer Vision, 
                Introduction to Artificial Intelligence, Data Science in Practice. I've also used Python to create a
                program that sorts my SD files by date and file type. 
            </li>
            <li> C 
            
                
                I believe that programming in C is like a double edge sword. When it works it can do so many amazing things, however
                when it doesn't... I'll be spending countless hours using GDB. I've programmed in C for most of my networks classes such as
                Computer Networks, Wireless Networks, and a bit in my Operating Systems class. 
            </li>
            <li> JavaScript
                
                Used JavaScript to write this website, and while taking a Web Client Languages class.

            </li>
            <li> SQL 
            
                Have not had much experience working in backend as of now, however I'm looking forward to expanding my skills in
                languages such as SQL. I learned and used SQL for my Database System Principles class. 
            </li>
            <li> C++
            
                 I learned and programmed in this language while taking an Advanced Data Structures class. I've also programmed in C++ while
                taking my Wireless Networks class.

            <li> Problem Solving </li>
            
               Have experience problem solving while working as a theater technican. Had to constantly solve technical problems such as
               light board not working correctly, sound board not configured correctly, and live stream wireless connection issues.
            
            <li> Creative </li>
            
                My work experience has allowed me the freedom to be creative and think outside the box.
            
            <li> Adaptability </li>
            
                Being adaptable is one of my biggest strength and had to constantly adapt to new environments in the work place
                and in my own personal life.
            
            <li> Time Management </li>
           
                Being a college student and part time employee has enabled me with the skill to manage my time.
