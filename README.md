# HW5
    For this homework assignment I ended up fixing issues that has to do
with my code not being wellformed. I also implemented some JavaScript
to make my website look nicer and easier to use. I also worked on the
data loader and local loader (project card) implementation. 




 ----- EXTRA -----
The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills and accomplishments to my future recruiters.
I started of with 
index.html
|_ contains my main channel with links to my other website pages and to my email address

index2.html
|_ contains an index of the 3 main sites I would like people to visit. These three links are -> projects page, interest page, and courses page. I implemented a localstorage and a digital storage
functionality using JavaScript. One retrieves my images from my local storage and the second retrieves the images from the service "firebase". I simply made an account and added my images to a folder.

projects.html
|_ This is where I present some of the pages I have been working on.

experiment.html
|_ The experimental page is used to experiment with different HTML, CSS and JavaScript features.
I practically use it as a playground and isn't meant to be taken seriously.

courses.html
|_ In this page I list most of the courses I have taken while attending UCSD. I do so by using a table tag and use the first column to add the course title, and second column to list the description of the course. Eventually I would like to implement a ranking system where I showcase my top picks.

interest.html
|_ This page has my main hobbies and a brief description of why I picked up this hobby.




Modifications made...
Implement the cards.html file.
Made some javascript adjustments to the main page (index.html) and to the interest page. I mainly tried fixing the image delay issues I had when loading up the page. This was primarly due to the files taking too long to fetch.
